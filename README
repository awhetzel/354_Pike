## Testing

* This project was tested with a very limited beta testing approach.
  Basically we had friends and family play the game after learning the
  rules to test the project. We also played it a lot ourselves to test.
  We also added and removed various print statements during testing to
  ensure that what we expected to happen in the code was in fact going 
  on behind the scenes. This type of debugging method was chosen due to
  lack of an IDE with a proper debugger for the language.
  

## Known Bugs
* Currently no known bugs
